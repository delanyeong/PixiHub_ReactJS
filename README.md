# PixiHub

PixiHub is a Movie app that can be used as a personal movie watchlist tracker for the all the user's favourite films and tv series. 

It mimics the UI of exisiting popular entertainment apps such as Netflix, Disney+, to allow the user to have an overview of different movie titles at a glance. 

Upon entering the app, the user is immediately greeted by the Trending page, which displays the top newest movies that just premiered.

Users are also able to search their favourite movies, using the search function at the app's search page. It displays the top matches.

Its interactive movie card enables the user to add chosen movies to favourites as a reminder to watch later, or add to watched if seen before. Clicking on the "i" at the corner of the card, blows it up into a modal window, displaying the movie summary to learn more about it, and a dedicated button to the watch its trailer via YouTube link. To return to the main page, simply just click on the "X" at the corner of the window or anywhere outside it to close the window.

The Favourites and Watched pages help keep track of the user's media content journey. Once movies are saved in one of these pages, any other page of the app that you access will be marked accordingly as well. So you never have to fret over bookmarking the same movies again! It can be used as a watchlist "binge reminder" ahead of a busy schedule, and a way to show off your movie count or how much of a Star Wars geek you are to your friends.
